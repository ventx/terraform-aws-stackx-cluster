  > Terraform cluster module which deploys a Kubernetes (EKS) cluster control-plane to AWS.
  > Supports logs ingested to CloudWatch via KMS encryption.
  > Deploys EKS Add-Ons "aws-vpc-cni" and "kube-proxy" with matching EKS control-plane version.
  > Creates an IAM OIDC provider to be used with EKS IRSA authentication mechanism. -- Part of stackx.

  ### stackx (RECOMMENDED)

  This is just a bare minimum example of how to use the module.
  See all available stackx modules here: https://github.com/ventx


  ```hcl
    module "aws-network" {
      source = "ventx/stackx-network/aws"
      version     = "0.1.0"
    }

    module "aws-cluster" {
      source          = "ventx/stackx-cluster/aws"
      version         = "0.1.0" // Pinned and tested version, generated by {x-release-please-version}
      cluster_version = "1.23"
      subnet_ids      = module.aws_network.private_subnet_ids
    }
  ```

  ### Single-Use

  ```hcl
    module "aws-cluster" {
      source = "ventx/stackx-cluster/aws"
      version     = "0.1.0" // Pinned and tested version, generated by {x-release-please-version}
      cluster_version = "1.22"
      subnet_ids = ["subnet-1", "subnet-2", "subnet-3"]
    }
  ```
